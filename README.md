# scikit-learn and Keras demo (Fall 2017, Machine Learning @ University of Utah)

This repo contains two ipython notebooks which demonstrate how to use some features of scikit-learn &amp; Keras.

## Step 1: Make sure you have python3 installed

Instructions here if you need to grab it: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Step 2: Grab this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/anniecherk/scikit_learn_and_keras_demo_fall_2017
cd scikit_learn_and_keras_demo_fall_2017
```

## Step 3: Install some pre-requisite libraries
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Note: this setup installs the "CPU version" of TensorFlow; if you're running some largely model you'll want to use the "GPU version" for much better efficiency. It's a slightly different setup that is outside the scope of this demo, but just something to keep in mind.

## Step 4: Run the ipython notebook
`jupyter notebook`
